<h2>Welcome to my blog</h2>
<p>
	<b>Welcome</b> to my new blog, as with many other technical blogs on the web, this one only exists because I wanted to build a blog.
</p>
<p>
	I've built a new blog at least a half dozen times over the years. Most of these attempts never went live, and really just served as a reason for me to play with some new technology or concept.
</p>
But unlike previous attempts, for once I have some actual goals in mind for this blog:

<ol>
	<li><b>I hope to run this on some silly hardware.</b> Where counting bits and bytes will become important.</li>
	<li><b>More than just a "Hello World" post for once.</b> I think I actually have some fun ideas to write about this time.</li>
	<li>
		<b>Avoid using frameworks, abstractions, or dependencies</b> as much as possible.
		I wouldn't say I hate "AI" or anything, but recently I've really wanted to get back to basics;
		so hand typing HTML and cobbling together fragile scripts it is.
	</li>
</ol>

<h2>The build script as it is</h2>
<p>
	Compared to the previous blog systems I've built this is by far the simplest and my favourite.
	I guess it could generously be described as a <b>very</b> simple templating system, but in reality it's just recursively calling python's <c>string.replace</c> as it descends directories.
</p>
<p>
	As we descend deeper into the directory structure, each level inherits from the parent level.
	This is done by having a special (non-page) <c>template.html</c> file in each directory.
	Every other <c>.html</c> file besides these becomes the content of the page nested inside the <c>template.html</c> file wherever the <c>&lt;replace/&gt;</c> tag appears inside of <c>template.hyml</c>.
	If the tag <c>&lt;replace/&gt;</c> appears in a template.html file, the Python script will replace that tag with the content of the child html files. Once it's done calling replace, the script spits out simple html files with all the resources inlined and compressed.
	Additionally any <c>style.css</c> files also get appended inline into the html, and all images etc. come along for the ride.
</p>
<p>
	So the blog post pages inherit from the blog template which inherits from the main page template, etc. etc.
	Obviously this has it's (substantial) limitations, but for the time being it serves it's purpose extremely well.
	I wrote the build script on an airplane (coding on the plane is a topic I'd love to cover soon) in 10 minute, it worked on my second try,
	and it finishes before I even realize it's started.
</p>
<p>
	So far it's very much in the spirit of what I wanted from this project. Eventually I'd like to reimplement this build script into bash, but we'll see about that.
