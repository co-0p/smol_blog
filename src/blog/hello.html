<h1>Hello 👋</h1>

<dt>October 28th, 2025</dt>

<h2>Hello, welcome to my blog</h2>
<p>
	As with many other technical blogs on the web, this really only exists because I wanted to build a blogging system.
</p>
<p>
	I've built a new blogging system at least a half dozen times over the years. Most of these attempts never went live, and really just served as a reason for me to play with some new technology or concept.
</p>

<h4>But unlike previous attempts, I have some goals in mind this time:</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Self host on some fun hardware.</li>
	<li>Post more than just a "Hello World" post for once. I think I actually have some fun ideas to write about this time.</li>
	<li>Build by hand, avoid dependencies, avoid bloat, avoid (too much) "AI" use.</li>
</ol>

<p>
	Towards these goals, I've created a small bash script to build my final HTML files using a very simple templating system. I call it <code>smol_build.sh</code>. Code found <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/co-0p/smol_build.sh">here</a>, and my first real blog post about it can be found <a  target="_blank" href="/blog/smol_build.sh.html">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
	 Additionally, if you're interested in looking at the code for this site, it's available on my <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/co-0p/">GitHub</a>. I also have <a href="https://x.com/c0_0p_">Twitter/X</a> if you want to keep tabs on me or say "hi".
</p>

<p>
	If you're reading this soon after it was written then there are still a number of things I'd like to get to before the site is done. I hope to be ticking them off in the coming weeks. Things like:

	<ul>
		<li>Add an RSS feed.</li>
		<li>Add <code>robots.txt</code> etc.</li>
		<li>Host the blog on my own hardware.</li>
		<li>Do something on the home page.</li>
		<li>Write some actual posts!</li>
		<li>Improve the robustness of build script.</li>
		<li>Automatic deployments.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<b>Thanks for stopping by</b>
